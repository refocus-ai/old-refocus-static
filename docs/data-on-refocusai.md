## Using the ReFocus Data Set

We are excited that you are here! We always encourage you to upload your own data, rather than rely on the ReFocus Dataset.

### Using your Data

Please do not upload [Personable Identifiable information](https://csrc.nist.gov/glossary/term/personally-identifiable-information) as it is not required for the model to provide accurate results.

##### Using your own data is recommended for accurate results.

- To train the model, we recommend using policies that are no longer in force.
- Start by uploading a .csv with 20 - 40 thousand data points.
- Never upload [Personable Identifiable information](https://csrc.nist.gov/glossary/term/personally-identifiable-information) as it is not required for the model to provide accurate results.

##### Making Predictions

- Prediction name (or placeholder)
- Person Name (or placeholder)
- Full Address
- The year the home was built

Run the prediction to get an estimated risk value.

### Using our Data

If you would still prefer to get started using the ReFocus dataset, we want to ensure you understand the limitations, and set expectations accordingly.

When you use the provided data, rather than uploading your own:

- The results will be less accurate. Finding high quality training data is hard. Our model is trained on a refined version of a Kaggle dataset. You can view the [original dataset here](https://www.kaggle.com/ycanario/home-insurance).
- The geographic area of the dataset is limited to California.
- We do not recommend utilizing the ReFocus dataset for anything other than getting a feel for how the platform works.
